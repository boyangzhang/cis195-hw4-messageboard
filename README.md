MESSAGEBOARD
---------------

Basic implementation
----------------------
Hit + to add a new message
Type a title and a message
Hit Post button in the top right to lower the keyboard and post the msg
Pull down in masterview to refresh for more messages

Bug
----
So I couldn't figure out why the title wasn't updating on the main page.
However if you pull down in the master view it will update the title.

EC: So I implemented a pull down refresh thing, sooo I think this should
be a cool enough EC feature??? =D??? <3
